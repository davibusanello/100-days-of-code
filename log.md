# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Improved my dotfiles, worked on Vue study.

### Day 1: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked in a Vue app and also continue the study the basics of it. I am following this series of screencast [Learn Vue 2: Step By Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/) from Laracasts.

**Thoughts:** I started to understand better the concepts and feel more confident.
