# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## This tracking my journey since I have started the challenge

### Day 0: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Improved my dotfiles, worked on Vue study.

**Thoughts:** After many years focusing on the backend and almost 1 and a half year trying to use a little of Angular and VueJs, I feel that I need to take deep in this new ecosystem of frontend frameworks, and today I returned to the study of Vue because I was struggling in the development of frontend

### Day 5: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continue working in the Vue app, also I worked in a wrapper to use 'yay' as Pacman wrapper in dotbot, and I am planning to extract it as dotbot's plugin to be available to others.
